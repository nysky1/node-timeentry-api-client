<h1>Volunteer Track</h1>

"VolunteerTrack" is designed to simplify tracking volunteer hours for institutions.  Many schools mandate that parents volunteer for a required number of hours per year. Many schools are still doing this tracking on paper or within the Office suite.  VolunteerTrack moves the management of these hours to a web based service and provides an administrator with the ability to verify and confirm activity hours.

A Spotify login is recommended so that when you choose an event, we can show a Spotify embedded music player allowing you to preview the selected HOT band.
